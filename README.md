Week 2/3: 
Create a Code Ninjas-based curriculum so kids can come in 2x a week and progress through the world of coding. We start with 10 base levels. As you level up, projects get harder. Once you complete all 10 projects, you can start choosing your own projects. Those projects can be like microbits or battlebots. This way Xperience can be a running business instead of only running during school breaks.

Create all 10 levels and go over them with Mr. Lueken for approval. After changes and support, start devising the curriculum in a folder where everything can be stored. 

Week 4: 
Keep developing the first couple of introduction levels and do more research about the one possible project that the kids can do within the first 10 levels. The idea is to have the students pick from 5 projects, so that they are guided and all helpers can assist the student.
